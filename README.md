## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional AI systems **hallucinate** when processing financial data.
* **User:** "What is our Q4 profit?"
* **ChatGPT:** "Your Q4 profit is approximately $4.2M"
* **Reality:** Actually $2.1M
* **Consequence:** Audit failure -> Lawsuit

---

## ✅ The Solution: The Steel Core Pattern

A **three-layer architecture** that guarantees zero hallucinations:

1. **ROUTER** -> Classifies intent, blocks LLM from guessing
2. **STEEL CORE (Python Logic)** -> Deterministic calculations only
3. **VOICE LAYER (Optional LLM)** -> Natural language formatting only

**Key Principle:** The LLM **never** sees raw data or performs calculations. Python does the math. The LLM just makes it readable.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. **Zero Hallucinations**
* All financial calculations use deterministic Python/Pandas.
* Every result is mathematically verifiable.

### 2. **Cryptographic Audit Trail**
Every calculation gets a unique, verifiable Audit ID.
`Total Profit: $4,876,543.21 (Audit ID: a3f5e9d2c1b8f4a7)`

### 3. **Enterprise-Ready**
* **SOX/GAAP Compliant:** Immutable audit logs (append-only) with SHA256 hashing.
* **Traceability:** "Drill to transaction" capability.
