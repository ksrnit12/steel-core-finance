# Steel Core Financial Engine 🛡️

**Neuro-Symbolic AI Architecture for Enterprise Finance**

> *"If you can't trace the number, you can't use the number."*

## 💡 The Problem
Generative AI (LLMs) is probabilistic. Financial reporting is deterministic.
Hallucinations in finance lead to audit failures.

## 🏗️ The Solution
I engineered a system that separates **Reasoning** from **Calculation**.
1.  **Intent Router:** Classifies user queries.
2.  **Deterministic Engine:** Python/Pandas performs the math.
3.  **Cryptographic Audit Trail:** Every output generates a SHA-256 hash.

## ⚡ Key Features
* **Zero Hallucinations:** Math is calculated, not predicted.
* **Drill-to-Transaction:** Every response includes a verifiable `Audit ID`.
* **Forensic Logging:** Immutable `.jsonl` records.
